# React i18next Proof of Concept (POC)

This project demonstrates the integration of **i18next** in a React application, showcasing various features and best practices for internationalization (i18n). It is divided into two versions:

- **Version 1**: Basic implementation of i18next with all translations in a single JSON file.
- **Version 2**: Enhanced setup with translations stored in separate files under a localized folder structure and additional advanced features.

---

## Features Covered

### **Version 1: Basic Implementation**
1. **Adding Translations**:  
   - Introduced translations for multiple languages within a single JSON file.  
   - Examples: English, French, Hindi, and Arabic.

2. **`useTranslation` Hook**:  
   - Demonstrated the usage of the `useTranslation` hook to fetch and render translations dynamically.

3. **Language Selector Component**:  
   - Created a language switcher to allow users to toggle between available languages seamlessly.

4. **Missing Key Fallback Language**:  
   - Handled missing translation keys by providing a fallback language (default to English).

5. **Nested Translation Key Handling**:  
   - Showcased how to handle nested keys in the translation JSON file.

6. **Handling Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages**:  
   - Implemented support for RTL languages like Arabic, including proper text direction and layout adjustments.

7. **Interpolation**:  
   - Demonstrated dynamic value injection into translation strings using placeholders.

8. **`Trans` Component**:  
   - Used the `Trans` component to render complex translations with HTML tags or React components.

---

### **Version 2: Advanced Implementation**
1. **Separate Locales Folder**:  
   - Moved translations into a `locales` folder, with separate JSON files for each language, improving maintainability and scalability.

2. **Serving Translation Files from Server**:  
   - Configured the application to fetch translation files dynamically from a server.

3. **Translation Namespaces**:  
   - Utilized namespaces to organize translations into modules or sections, allowing selective loading of translations.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaumyaSingh0208/i18NextPOC.git
   cd  i18NextPOC
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Switch Languages**:  
   - Use the language selector in the application to switch between available languages.
